      The NeuroBot is a neural network algorithm created for forecasting
      exchange rates of cryptocurrencies. The neural network collects and
      analyses Data 24/7 and provides forecasts for various cryptocurrencies'
      exchange rates. There are three types of forecasts: 24 hours, 48 hours and
      one week. Neural network algorithm implemented with algorithms of the
      essential aspects of technical analysis, such as patterns and signal
      indicators calculate forecast Data with one second time.

      The program will be further upgraded by introducing the remaining elements
      of technical analysis (Fibonacci retracement, the Elliot wave theory , etc
      ) and fundamental analysis - market news algorithms will be implemented -
      one more neural network with functions to determine positive and negative
      tendencies of the market.
